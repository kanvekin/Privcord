# Contributing to Kernixcord

Kernixcord is a community project and welcomes any kind of contribution from anyone!

We have development documentation for new contributors, which can be found at https://wwww.discord.gg/.

All contributions should be made in accordance with our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to contribute

Contributions can be sent via discord requests.

### Plugin Rules

- No simple slash command plugins like `/cat`. Instead, make a [user installable Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/change-log#userinstallable-apps-preview)
- No simple text replace plugins like Let me Google that for you. The TextReplace plugin can do this
- No raw DOM manipulation. Use proper patches and React
- No FakeDeafen or FakeMute
- No StereoMic
- No plugins that simply hide or redesign ui elements. This can be done with CSS
- No plugins that interact with specific Discord bots (official Discord apps like Youtube WatchTogether are okay)
- No selfbots or API spam (animated status, message pruner, auto reply, nitro snipers, etc)
- No untrusted third party APIs. Popular services like Google or GitHub are fine, but absolutely no self hosted ones
- No plugins that require the user to enter their own API key
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary and warranted

## Improve Kernixcord itself

If you have any ideas on how to improve Kernixcord itself, or want to propose a new plugin API, feel free to open a feature request so we can discuss.

Or if you notice any bugs or typos, feel free to fix them!

## Help out users in our Discord community

We have an open support channel in our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/).
Helping out users there is always appreciated! The more, the merrier.
